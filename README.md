The "Smart Greenhouse" project, implemented with STM32 board using STM32CubeIDE, uses advanced technology to control plant conditions with the help of various sensors such as soil moisture sensor, air humidity sensor and temperature sensor to optimize each phase of growth that automatically captures and delivers information 24/7 about the environment and the crop.
